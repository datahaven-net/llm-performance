I would like you to write a document asking for donations for
MIA, which stands for Missions to Interstellar Asteroids  

As far as we currently know, all life or intelligence in the universe is located on Earth.  
It would be nice to see some life headed far away from Earth.  
However, we don't really have the tech to do that now.
The key MIA idea is to send off a minimal probe to a passing interstellar asteroid
with near current tech and then
to transmit upgraded tech to it over the coming years.  With enough upgrades it could
get to where it could survive the long journey to some distant star system and spread life there.

An interstellar asteroid already has a huge amount of resources heading out of our solar system.
If a probe could use these it could have plenty of material to make spare parts and new things during its long
journey.
There have been 2 interstellar asteroids that we know of that pass through our solar system in the last decade.

As we get better telescopes I expect we will see interstellar asteroids even more often.
The MIA mission is to send probes to such passing
asteroids from time to time.

The interstellar asteroids we have seen so far, and expect to see in the future, are moving at
speeds such that it will take them thousands of years to get to another star system.   If civilization
on Earth is not destroyed, they will make newer probes that pass these interstellar asteroids and
get to the other star systems long before they do.  By the time the asteroid based probes reach there will be
millions of people at their destination, if all goes well.  So these probes will pose no danger to
humans if all goes well.  If something destroys all life on Earth, these probes might be the only
chance of life in the Universe.  

The machines in the probes would have AI.   Although AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
may not be available at the time of launch, the probe could likely be upgraded to incorporate
AGI at a later stage.  

Initially power could come from an RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator).  
We might use Americium-241 as it has a half-life of around 432 years and the radiation is not too hard to shield.
The Voyager probes RTGs have lasted more than 50 years, with careful design we believe a 200+ year
usable life target is reasonable.
This would give plenty of time to develop a replacement power source.
Depending on what is found on the asteroid and what
tech comes along on Earth a fusion or fission reactor could eventually be built on the asteroid.

It seems that Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) nuclear-fusion rocket engines might be available
on a time frame that fits with this project.   If so, they could be ideal for this project.
It is a very high ISP rocket and could get the probe to the speeds needed to land on an
interstellar asteroid.

The machines would dig tunnels in the asteroid and brace them with something made from asteroid materials.
Once built they would spend most of their time inside these tunnels to avoid radiation,
limit temperature fluctuation, and minimize risk of being hit by micrometeoroids.

The initial system would need to be able to refine materials from the asteroid and use a
3D printer to make things.   Later, instructions could be sent for making all sorts of things.

The reusable and huge SpaceX StarShip will soon greatly reduce the cost of getting things to space.
So much larger space projects will be feasible soon.

One of the first things to be made from asteroid materials would be a large antenna to communicate
back to Earth at a higher data-rate.

Some things, like computer chips, would not be manufactured on the asteroid for a long time,
so many spare chips would be included in the original cargo.

It might be possible someday to send tech on how to make seeds for plants starting with digital
information.   So while it will not launch with any biological life, it may be possible
 to seed planets with organic life.  It will carry DNA information for a variety of life.
So this might spread both organic life and AI life.

Eventually it would be possible to make everything needed to replace anything needed for the mission.
Once achieved, the mission could survive until it reaches another star system.
With data scrubbing and unlimited spare parts the mission could last over 1,000 years.

Some tech will advance naturally without any work by MIA over the coming years.
Some tech would not be developed till after the probe has been launched and then transmitted later.
However, some tech would need to be developed by MIA to enable this project,
and that is what we will focus on.

Before there is enough funds raised to start work on the probes funds will be used to create
prizes, similar to the Xprizes, for accomplishments of tech useful for this project.

Please write a two page, or longer, proposal seeking donations from the general public to support MIA.  Give th
e motivation,
the reasoning, estimates for the time-frame, the yearly cost, the manpower needed, and the key technical areas

that MIA would have to develop, possible prizes, etc.   Feel free to ignore
anything above or add any related ideas as long as you keep the key idea of sending probes to passing
interstellar asteroids.  Do include that the MIA website is at http://mia.voyage
